# Coyote
Welcome to Coyote - a fast, lightweight language designed for data engineers in mind. It lets you use the best features of both Functional and Object-Oriented languages. The philosophy of the Coyote language is to incorporate the power of a full-fledged language with built-in SQL databases and OLAP so that the tight integration between both provides a seamless experience that adds power to Data Science and Data Analytics.

Unlike scripting languages, Coyote makes you declare your variables and provides the security that comes from compile-time type checking. At the same time, it offers extensive data manipulation structures that can be combined as needed. Multi-dimensional arrays can contain classes and functions, functions can be stored in Data Frames, and all objects can be passed as parameters to functions or methods.
